# Frontend Configuration Template
# Copy this file to .env and update with your actual values
#
# IMPORTANT: These values are used in DEVELOPMENT mode only.
# In production (Docker/Kubernetes), configuration is injected at runtime
# via environment variables set in the container/Helm values.

# Backend API URL (REQUIRED)
# Development: typically http://localhost:8000
# Production: Injected at runtime via VITE_API_URL environment variable
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Mailcatcher (development only - not used in production)
MAILCATCHER_HOST=http://localhost:1080

# OAuth Configuration (OPTIONAL - leave unset to disable OAuth login)
# NOTE: Both VITE_OAUTH_AUTHORITY and VITE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID must be set together.
# If you set only one, config generation will fail with a validation error.
#
# Development: Set these values to test OAuth locally
# Production: Injected at runtime via VITE_OAUTH_* environment variables
#
# VITE_OAUTH_AUTHORITY=https://your-oauth-provider.com
# VITE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
# VITE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/oauth-callback
# VITE_OAUTH_SCOPE=openid email profile
